        A few years ago I started traveling and it gave me a long lasting
        feeling of connection, with myself and with the world. I substituted the
        temporary distractions that in no way benefited me or my body and
        started to look at traveling as a way to reduce my stress and engage
        with the community while simultaneously gaining a new perspective and
        knowledge of the world around me. Solo travel as become specially
        attractive as I can move at my own pace and have much more control over
        my planning. Some of my favorite travelling themes include nature
        exploring, street art, leftist/feminist movement and macabre/abandonned
        places.
